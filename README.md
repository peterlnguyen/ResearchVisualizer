Research_Visualizer
===================

The program to execute is called InteractiveView22, which is in the
src folder.  It was a modification of the sample class
InteractiveView2 provided by Jung.  Attached is that sample class as
well as Jung's tutorial I used as a reference.

Dependencies:
1. Jung package
2. ScreenImage class in src folder (used to write to file)

I was never able to save coordinates between different executions of
graphs (e.g. random_walk_100 vs random_walk_300), but I just reran the
program until the similar shaped graph appeared.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.
