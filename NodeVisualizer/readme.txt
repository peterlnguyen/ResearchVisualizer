This program takes in a list of networked nodes and the order of how the nodes are activated, visualizing them using Java's Jung package, displaying each step with a slide.

The program to execute is called InteractiveView22, which is in the
src folder.  It was a modification of the sample class
InteractiveView2 provided by Jung.  Attached is that sample class as
well as Jung's tutorial I used as a reference.

Dependencies:
1. Jung package
2. ScreenImage class in src folder (used to write to file).  I found this class online and do not take any credit.
